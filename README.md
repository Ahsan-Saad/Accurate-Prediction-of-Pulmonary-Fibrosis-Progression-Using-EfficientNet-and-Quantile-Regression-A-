### Forking Reason  
This project was collaboratively developed as part of our undergraduate research, with all code and commits made from a shared lab computer under one GitHub ID. As a result, my individual GitHub ID does not appear in the commit history. I have forked this repository to my personal account to reflect my significant contributions to the project and ensure transparency regarding my involvement.

### My Contributions  
I was actively involved in all aspects of this project, with significant contributions to the following areas:  
1. **Data Preprocessing**:  
   - Analyzed and processed the OSIC dataset, ensuring the data was clean, structured, and ready for training.  
   - Designed pipelines to integrate medical imaging data in DICOM format, patient demographics, and lab results into a unified format.  

2. **Model Training and Evaluation**:  
   - Played a key role in fine-tuning the EfficientNet architecture for optimal performance on the PF progression prediction task.  
   - Designed and integrated Quantile Regression (QR) to estimate prediction uncertainty effectively.  
   - Evaluated model performance using Laplace-Log-Likelihood and performed rigorous experiments to achieve the final result.  

3. **Collaborative Research**:  
   - Contributed to the research methodology and experimental design, ensuring a robust and reproducible approach.  
   - Authored significant portions of the research paper, detailing the technical implementation and results.
   - Wrote the manuscript which later got submitted and published.

### Key Highlights of the Project  
- Leveraged **EfficientNet**, a state-of-the-art CNN architecture, for extracting meaningful features from CT scans.  
- Incorporated **Quantile Regression (QR)** to enhance prediction accuracy and uncertainty estimation.  
- Achieved a **Laplace-Log-Likelihood score of -6.64**, outperforming existing literature on PF progression prediction.
